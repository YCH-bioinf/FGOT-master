## Data
All datasets used in this study are already published and were obtained from public data repositories. Simulated datasets 1 and 2 were two batches of scRNA-seq with batch effects generated by the R package 'Splatter'. The PBMC data was published on https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-multiome-atac-gex/datasets/1.0.0/pbmc_granulocyte_sorted_10k?. The BMMC data was obtained from the GEO repository (accession no. GSE159417). The spatial-ATAC-RNA-seq mouse brain data was from https://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=brain-spatial-omics.

The details of all datasets used are available in the Methods section. The data used in our experiments have been uploaded and are freely available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H3GLroILCYSaGjowwJUjaO4JlKcNDdvy.

## Tutorial
For the step-by-step tutorial, we would release it soon.
